Variant-specific symptoms of COVID-19 in a study of 1,542,510 adults in England

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus is associated with a wide range of symptoms. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission −1 (REACT-1) study monitored the spread and clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 among random samples of the population in England from 1 May 2020 to 31 March 2022. We show changing symptom profiles associated with the different variants over that period, with lower reporting of loss of sense of smell or taste for Omicron compared to previous variants, and higher reporting of cold-like and influenza-like symptoms, controlling for vaccination status. Contrary to the perception that recent variants have become successively milder, Omicron BA.2 was associated with reporting more symptoms, with greater disruption to daily activities, than BA.1. With restrictions lifted and routine testing limited in many countries, monitoring the changing symptom profiles associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and effects on daily activities will become increasingly important.

A meta-analysis of studies from the first wave of the pandemic identified 30 symptoms reported in multiple studies, including common influenza-like symptoms (cough, fever, myalgia/fatigue, headache, sputum production), and less common but more specific symptoms including change or loss of sense of smell or taste.

Previous community-based studies have assessed the degree to which symptom data can predict polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity for SARS-CoV-2, and have used variable selection and ranking techniques to identify the most important (set of) symptoms for case identification. Further studies have indicated that symptom profiles may differ between variants of SARS-CoV-2.

The relationship between symptom profile and cycle threshold (Ct) value from PCR testing (an established proxy for viral load, which in turn correlates with infectiousness) has yet to be fully investigated. Identifying individuals who are more likely to be (i) infected, and (ii) infectious on the basis of symptom profile would have clinical value as governments move away from mass testing programmes and mandatory isolation measures.

Here, we use regression modelling and variable selection models in the large community-based REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission −1 (REACT-1) study that was in the field approximately monthly from 1 May 2020 to 31 March 2022 to i) describe the symptom profiles of the main variants of SARS-CoV-2 that have been dominant in England and worldwide over this period, namely wild-type, Alpha, Delta and Omicron BA.1 and BA.2, and ii) identify the symptoms that are most predictive of high viral load, and hence infectiousness, for each variant.

Results

Descriptive and univariable analysis

The characteristics of our study population are summarised in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. It comprised 1,542,510 adults aged 18 and over, including a total of 17,448 swab positive individuals: 2971 (0.4%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [0.4,0.4] unweighted prevalence) for wild type; 2275 (0.6% [0.6,0.7]) for Alpha; 1493 (0.7% [0.6,0.7]) for Delta and 10,709 (4.4% [4.3,4.5]) for Omicron variants.

The proportion of swab positive individuals reporting any of 26 symptoms was highest in those infected with BA.2 (75.9% [74.4,77.2], compared with 70.0% [68.3,71.6] in those with BA.1, 63.8% [61.3,66.2] in those with Delta, 54.7%, [52.7,56.8] in those with Alpha and 45.0% [43.3,46.8] in those with wild-type). Background prevalence of symptoms was also highest during January–March 2022, when Omicron dominated: 21.9%, [21.7,22.0] of all respondents reported one or more symptoms, compared with 13.5% [13.4,13.5] during the wild-type period.

Those infected with BA.2 reported an average of 6.0 (95% CI 5.8,6.2) symptoms in the week prior to PCR testing, compared with 2.70 (2.6,2.8), 3.4 (3.2,3.6), 4.6 (4.4,4.9) and 4.6 (4.5,4.8) for wild-type, Alpha, Delta and BA.1 respectively. A larger proportion of people with BA.2 reported that their symptoms had affected their ability to carry out day-to-day activities 'a lot' (17.6% [16.3,18.8]) compared with those infected with BA.1 (10.7% [9.6,11.9]) or Delta (10.5%, [9.1,12.2]).

All symptoms were positively associated with swab positivity for all variants. The odds ratio for swab positivity of 'any' vs 'none' of 26 symptoms was highest for BA.2 (OR = 12.9 [11.9,14.0], compared with 5.7 [4.8,5.6], 6.0 [5.1,7.1], 9.5 [8.6,10.6] and 9.6 [8.8,10.5] for wild-type, Alpha, Delta and BA.1, respectively).

Unlike for wild-type, Alpha, and Delta, where the highest odds ratios for swab positivity were for loss or change of sense of smell (ORs 49.7 [44.3,55.7], 37.8 [28.6,50.0] and 73.4 [64.2,83.9], respectively) or taste (ORs 35.9 [31.9,40.4], 38.9 [29.9,50.6] and 68.1 [59.4,78.0] respectively), for BA.1 and BA.2 influenza-like and cold-like symptoms were relatively more predictive of swab positivity, and loss or change of sense of smell or taste relatively less so. Within BA.1 and BA.2, the highest odds ratio of all symptoms was for fever: ORs were 18.4 [16.5,20.5] for BA.1 and 30.2 [27.7,33.0] for BA.2, compared with 12.9 [11.1,15.1] and 17.2 [15.1,19.5] respectively for loss or change of sense of smell and 16.0 [13.9,18.5] and 21.3 [18.9,24.0] respectively for loss or change of sense of taste.

A pooled analysis reinforced the findings from the univariable analysis after adjusting for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and background symptom prevalence, showing that Alpha and Delta were associated with increased symptom-specific odds ratios across most symptoms, while Omicron BA.1 was associated with lower odds ratios across most symptoms, and especially for the loss of sense of smell or taste. Omicron BA.2 was associated with increased odds ratios vs BA.1, most notably for cold-like symptoms and chills.

Multivariable analysis for variable selection

We used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalised logistic regression to identify parsimonious symptom sets selected as jointly and positively predictive of swab positivity for each variant; this method takes into account differences in symptom cooccurrence by variant. Loss or change of sense of taste, new persistent cough, and fever were selected for each variant. Notably, cold-like symptoms of runny nose, sore throat, sneezing and hoarse voice were only selected for Omicron (BA.1 and BA.2).

Omicron (BA.1 and BA.2)

Comparing symptoms for BA.2 vs BA.1 using logistic regression (based on either model adjustment or matching see "Methods"), infection with BA.2 was positively associated with chest pain, severe fatigue, runny nose, muscle aches, sneezing, fever, chills, tiredness, blocked nose and headache (in both sets of analyses); in unmatched analyses, infection with BA.2 was further associated with sore eyes, appetite loss and new persistent cough.

In a subgroup of 5,598 double- and triple-vaccinated swab-positive individuals with BA.1 or BA.2, those infected with BA.2 were 54% more likely to report symptoms that interfered with their ability to carry out day-to-day activities 'a lot' (OR 1.54 [1.16, 2.06]) vs 'a little', 'not at all', or not reporting any symptoms, after adjustment for age group, sex, vaccine count, time since most recent vaccine, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, time since symptom onset and calendar time. In the same models, men were 38% less likely than women to report symptoms that interfered with their ability to carry out day-to-day activities 'a lot' (0.62 [0.52,0.73]). Vaccine booster status and time since vaccination were not associated with ability to carry out daily activities. In the same subgroup, a log-linear regression of symptom count found that those infected with BA.2 reported 14% more symptoms, on average, than those with BA.1 (OR = 1.14 [1.10,1.19]) after adjustment for the same covariates as above.

Ct values. Ct values were lower for BA.2 than BA.1. This may reflect the timing of the sampling with respect to the growth of the variant since more recent infections will tend to have lower Ct values. As expected, symptomatic individuals had lower Ct values (higher viral loads) than asymptomatic people. In linear regression models among swab positive individuals in rounds 17–19 (5 January to 31 March 2022), for each of the 26 surveyed symptoms, symptom reporting was associated with a lower Ct value. The lowest adjusted Ct values were for influenza-like or cold-like symptoms: fever, chills, sore throat, muscle aches, runny nose, sneezing and headache, which frequently co-occurred. With the exception of fever, these symptoms were also commonly reported as the first symptom among symptomatic swab positives.

Discussion

In this study of more than 1.5 million adults randomly selected from the population in England, we show differences in symptom reporting associated with Omicron compared with previous variants, and within Omicron for BA.2 vs BA.1. This may reflect changes in the underlying pathophysiology associated with different variants, affecting, for example, receptor binding, cell entry or host response, against a background of differing levels of population immunity (both from natural infection and vaccine-induced).

We found that loss or change of sense of smell or taste were less predictive of swab positivity for Omicron than for other variants, and that cold-like symptoms were more predictive for Omicron than for previous variants. Both these findings were consistent with previous reports. Specifically, infections with Omicron variants are not as strongly associated with anosmia compared with previous variants. The loss of sense of smell or taste following infection with earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2 results from the downregulated expression of olfactory receptors. It is possible that changes in the sequence of viral genes that regulate host responses in Omicron reduce this effect; detailed transcriptomic studies in animal models and humans may help to pinpoint the mechanisms involved.

Comparison of the intrinsic severity of SARS-CoV-2 variants is complex, owing to changing levels of population immunity due to prior infection or vaccination. However, the rapid replacement of BA.1 by BA.2, and the large number of PCR positives, afforded an opportunity for comparison of the symptom burden and symptom severity of the two variants within a population with similar characteristics against a similar background of non-COVID-related illness and symptoms.

Comparing Omicron BA.2 with BA.1, we found that those with BA.2 were more likely to be symptomatic, to report a number of influenza-like and cold-like symptoms, and, in adjusted models, to report more symptoms, and to report that their symptoms affected their day-to-day activities 'a lot'. The last two findings were robust to adjustment for vaccine booster status and time since most recent vaccine dose and are therefore unlikely to be explained by vaccination status or waning immunity following vaccination. The effects were somewhat attenuated by the addition of time since symptom onset and calendar time, suggesting that the higher symptom burden and severity of BA.2 (vs BA.1) may to some extent reflect the detection of swab positivity earlier in the disease course for BA.2; this is consistent with the higher transmissibility of BA.2 in a highly vaccinated population. Nonetheless, following adjustment, BA.2 was associated with 54% greater odds of symptoms affecting day-to-day activities 'a lot', and reporting of one additional symptom, on average, compared to BA.1.

While other studies of the BA.2 and BA.1 variants suggested that they were of similar severity in terms of case hospitalisation rate or case fatality rate, the greater symptom burden and severity for BA.2 shown here may still be associated with substantial disruption to daily living, and have wider societal and economic impact.

From 1 April 2022 the UK government moved to a policy of 'living with COVID'. With the lifting of restrictions and limited access to free testing limited, identifying individuals who are particularly likely to be infectious on the basis of symptoms alone may help reduce ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We show that in the Omicron period reporting fever, chills, sore throat, muscle aches, runny nose, sneezing and headache was associated with the lowest adjusted Ct values and therefore most likely to be indicative of higher viral load and increased infectiousness.

Our study has limitations. Response rates varied between 11.7% and 26.5% for rounds 2–19, so the samples may not be fully representative of, or results fully generalisable to, the population. Nevertheless, our random community sampling procedure included individuals from all of the 315 lower tier local authority areas in England in each round, ensuring wide geographical coverage and socioeconomic and demographic diversity. The symptoms surveyed were not exhaustive but, while not specific to COVID-19, were all shown to be predictive of SARS-CoV-2 swab positivity. Our analysis covers a period of 22 months, during which time background levels of natural and vaccine-acquired immunity varied substantially, making it difficult to differentiate the effect of viral mutations from the impact of vaccines and prior infection. As REACT-1 data collection was non-continuous, we may have captured different stages of epidemic growth across variants, which may have differentially affected symptom reporting at different times.

Of those who provided valid swabs and consented to linkage in rounds 1–19 of REACT-1 (2,191,597 people in total), approximately 3% (65,915 people) participated in more than one round. On this basis, a correction factor of 1.015 could therefore be applied to the standard error estimates. We are not able to definitively identify instances of participation in more than one round among those who did not consent to linkage. However, because the consent-based estimate of the correction factor is so close to one, we feel confident reporting uncorrected standard errors and confidence intervals.

In summary, we have detected differences in symptom profiles reported during nearly 2 years of the COVID-19 epidemic in England, reflecting the emergence of different variants over that period against a background of varying immunity from prior infection and vaccination. Most recently, infection with Omicron is associated with lower reporting of loss or change of sense of smell and taste, and higher reporting of cold-like and influenza-like symptoms. Sequence-confirmed BA.2 was associated with reporting of more symptoms and greater disruption to daily activity compared with BA.1. As routine testing becomes more limited in many countries, and as new variants emerge, understanding the symptom profiles which can identify individuals with a higher risk of transmission will become increasingly important.
