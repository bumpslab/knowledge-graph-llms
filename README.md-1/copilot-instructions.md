# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This project is designed to [insert project purpose]. The architecture consists of several key components that interact to achieve the overall functionality. Understanding the following major components is crucial:

- **Component A**: [Brief description of Component A and its role]
- **Component B**: [Brief description of Component B and its role]
- **Data Flow**: Data flows between components through [describe data flow mechanisms, e.g., APIs, message queues].

## Developer Workflows
To build and test the project, use the following commands:

- **Build**: Run `npm run build` to compile the project.
- **Test**: Execute `npm test` to run the test suite.
- **Debugging**: Use `npm run debug` to start the application in debug mode.

These commands are essential for ensuring the code is functioning as expected and for troubleshooting issues.

## Project-Specific Conventions
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow the [specific naming conventions] for files and variables.
- **Code Structure**: Organize code into directories based on functionality, such as `controllers`, `models`, and `services`.

## Integration Points
The project integrates with the following external dependencies:
- **Dependency A**: [Description of Dependency A and its purpose]
- **Dependency B**: [Description of Dependency B and its purpose]

Communication between components typically occurs through [describe communication patterns, e.g., REST APIs, event-driven architecture].

## Key Files/Directories
- **src/**: Contains the main application code.
- **tests/**: Contains unit and integration tests.
- **docs/**: Documentation related to the project.
